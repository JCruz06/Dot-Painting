# Spot Painting Recreation with Python Turtle

This project recreates Damien Hirst's famous Spot Paintings using Python's Turtle module. The recreation process involves extracting colors from an image of one of Hirst's paintings and then using those colors to create a similar spot painting programmatically.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

1. **color_extract.py**: Extracts colors from the reference painting image.
2. **main.py**: Uses the extracted colors to create a spot painting using the Turtle module.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `turtle`
- `colorgram.py`

You can install `colorgram.py` using pip:
```bash
pip install colorgram.py
